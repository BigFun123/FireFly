Brief

Create a 2D game where any character that you come up with (can make it fun) have to run away on the screen via mouse movement from the other game characters.

You can add other game objects as you wish or change any dynamics of the game to make it more fun or just for your own creative mind :)

Rules

• Use Unity.
• C# code only.
• List any 3rd party packages or libraries that you use like a library for doing collision detection.
• Create in Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch all your 2D game characters. Provide the files as part of your deliverable.
• Should run on Mac OSX as a desktop app or Android or on Windows. We are flexible.
• Provide binary of platform.
• The project should be saved in a private repo on (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, you pick)
• Bonus: Add sound.

Notes

• Keep it simple
• Keep it DRY
• Follow good design patterns
• Follow good development practices
• We aren’t looking for flashy graphics. Plain 2D only even if it's black and white.
• We are looking for solid development skills
• Worry less about UI and more about services and clean maintainable code
